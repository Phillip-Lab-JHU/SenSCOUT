    "Either ReCombat or Z-score compared to control were used to compare data across biological repeats. This workflow will show the ReCombat algorithm across conditions across biological repeats. This run assumes no ground truth run, but that can be adjusted for in the ReCombat source code. Batch correction (and Z-score comparisons) works best on gaussian distributions, so we performed log transformations on biomarker expressions. This code will walk through batch correction for p16 expression for young control for two biorepeats (note for the paper we performed a two-axis correction as we had p21 costained with one of the remaining four biomarkers."
